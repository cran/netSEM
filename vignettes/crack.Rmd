Data Description
-----------------------------------

A dataset of cracks in photovoltaic backsheets with inner layers of either ethylene-vinyl acetate or polyethylene exposed to 4,000 hours of continuous UVA irradiance with an intensity of 1.55 $w/m^2$ at 340 $nm$ and a chamber temperature of 70$^\circ$C. 
See the associated journal article in Polymer Degradation and Stability for details on obtaining quantitative crack measurements [@klinke_2018_non-destructive].

97 observations of 5 variables are included: 
 
 * __Response - dAvgNorm:__ average crack depth normalized by the backsheet's inner layer thickness, dimensionless.
 * __Stress - uva360dose:__ cumulative, integrated irradiance dose received by the sample for all wavelengths $<$ 360 $nm$, in $MJ/m^2$.
 * __Mechanism - crys730:__ percent crystallinity of polyethylene regions determined from the ratio of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy peak intensities at 731 and 720 $cm^{-1}$ [@huang_attenuated_1992], dimensionless.
 * __Mechanism - carb1715:__ ketone carbonyl index determined from the ratio of FTIR peak intensities at 1715 and 2851 $cm^{-1}$, dimensionless.
 * __Mechanism - carbPC1:__ 1st principal component score for the carbonyl region between 1500 and 1800 $cm^{-1}$.
 
Load data and run code to build netSEM 
------------------------------------------
```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Load the crack data set and preview column metadata
data(crack)
?crack

## Run netSEMp1 model
ans1 <- netSEMp1(crack)
## Plot the network model for principle 1
plot(ans1, cutoff = c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6))

## Run netSEMp2 model
ans2 <- netSEMp2(crack)
## Plot the network model for principle 2
plot(ans2, cutoff = c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6))
```

Network diagram for data
--------------------------
dAvgNorm is the endogenous and all other variables are considered as exogenous. 
Based on the plot, the strongest pathway appears to be uva360dose $\rightarrow$ carb1715 $\rightarrow$ dAvgNorm.
This can be confirmed using the `pathwayRMSE()` function.
